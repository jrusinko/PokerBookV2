  title: Detecting Cheating and Collusion
  part: 'Part VI: Randomness, Variance, and Statistical Judgment'
  motivating_example: Two players rarely play big pots against each other. Is it coincidence,
    shared style, or collusion?
  math:
    definitions:
    - null hypothesis
    - alternative hypothesis
    - test statistic
    - p-value
    - false positive/false negative
    concepts:
    - statistical power (informal)
    - multiple testing
    - correlation vs causation
    - evidence vs proof
    theorems:
    - hypothesis testing framework (conceptual)
  poker_topics:
  - 25 Statistical Inference from Results
  - 24 Randomness and Fair Dealing
  applications:
  - fraud detection (finance/insurance)
  - academic integrity (plagiarism/cheating detection)
  - network analysis (collusion detection)

    title: Accusation and Due Process
    theme: Statistical suspicion is not proof. How much evidence is enough to accuse
      someone, and what safeguards prevent moral panics?
