**Chapter at a glance**

- **Part:** Part III: Game Theory (Intro / Toy Models)
- **Poker topics:** 15 Exploitative Play, 13 Nash Equilibrium (GTO)
- **Beyond poker:** pricing strategy (responding to consumers), negotiation (adaptive vs principled), algorithmic trading (exploiting inefficiencies)

## Motivating Example

Against a weak player, strict equilibrium play seems too passive; against a strong player, exploitation can backfire. When should you deviate?

**Guiding question.** When should we deviate from equilibrium to exploit opponents, and what are the risks?

- Situation: Against a weak player, strict equilibrium play seems too passive; against a strong player, exploitation can backfire. When should you deviate?
- Why it matters: this introduces 15 Exploitative Play, 13 Nash Equilibrium (GTO).

## Mathematical Framework and Poker Theory

### Roadmap

- What equilibrium guarantees
- What exploitation targets
- How to model opponent tendencies
- Measuring cost of being wrong

### Definitions

**exploitative strategy.** *[Definition.]*

**deviation.** *[Definition.]*

**counter-strategy.** *[Definition.]*

**exploitability (informal).** *[Definition.]*

### Core concepts

- robustness vs exploitation
- best-response logic
- model misspecification

### Core results

**best-response principle.** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

**exploitability as performance gap (conceptual).** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

### Worked example ideas

- Given opponent overfold rate, compute an exploitative bluff frequency and compare to equilibrium

### Computation notes

['Optional: sensitivity analysis over opponent parameters']

## Beyond Poker

These applications use the same core mathematical move: define a model, quantify uncertainty/value, and choose actions under constraints.

Possible directions:

- pricing strategy (responding to consumers)
- negotiation (adaptive vs principled)
- algorithmic trading (exploiting inefficiencies)

## Liberal Arts Sidebar

**Exploitation in Everyday Life**

*Lens:* Ethics

*Theme:* When is taking advantage of others acceptable if all parties consent? Contrast games vs real-world power imbalances.

> Is exploitation wrong if everyone consents? How do power differences change the answer?

## Homework Problems
