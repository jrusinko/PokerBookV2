**Chapter at a glance**

- **Part:** Part VI: Randomness, Variance, and Statistical Judgment
- **Poker topics:** 2 Variance and Volatility, 3 Risk vs Reward Tradeoffs
- **Beyond poker:** insurance (ruin probabilities), personal finance (retirement drawdown risk), entrepreneurship (runway and failure risk)

## Motivating Example

A skilled player goes broke after a downswing; another survives by lowering stakes. How do we quantify survival under variance?

**Guiding question.** How does variance interact with limited resources over time (and when do you go broke)?

- Situation: A skilled player goes broke after a downswing; another survives by lowering stakes. How do we quantify survival under variance?
- Why it matters: this introduces 2 Variance and Volatility, 3 Risk vs Reward Tradeoffs.

## Mathematical Framework and Poker Theory

### Roadmap

- Variance over repeated play
- Bankroll constraints and survival
- Risk of ruin models
- Kelly/log-utility intuition

### Definitions

**bankroll.** *[Definition.]*

**risk of ruin.** *[Definition.]*

**growth rate.** *[Definition.]*

**log utility (optional).** *[Definition.]*

### Core concepts

- downswings
- long-run vs short-run
- Kelly criterion (conceptual)

### Core results

**law of large numbers (informal).** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

**risk-of-ruin formulas (simple models).** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

### Worked example ideas

- Compute risk-of-ruin in a simple win/loss model for two bankroll choices

### Computation notes

['Simulate bankroll trajectories to visualize ruin frequency']

## Beyond Poker

These applications use the same core mathematical move: define a model, quantify uncertainty/value, and choose actions under constraints.

Possible directions:

- insurance (ruin probabilities)
- personal finance (retirement drawdown risk)
- entrepreneurship (runway and failure risk)

## Liberal Arts Sidebar

**Survivorship Bias**

*Lens:* Sociology

*Theme:* We hear from winners, not from those who went broke. How does survivorship bias distort beliefs about skill and risk?

> How does survivorship bias shape our beliefs about merit, skill, and success?

## Homework Problems
