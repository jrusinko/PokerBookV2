**Chapter at a glance**

- **Part:** Part III: Game Theory (Intro / Toy Models)
- **Poker topics:** 13 Nash Equilibrium (GTO), 14 Indifference Conditions
- **Beyond poker:** economics (market competition models), political science (strategic voting/campaigning), evolutionary biology (stable strategies)

## Motivating Example

You hear “the correct bluff frequency makes them indifferent.” What does that mean mathematically, and why does it prevent exploitation?

**Guiding question.** What does it mean for strategies to be mutually stable—and how do indifference conditions determine frequencies?

- Situation: You hear “the correct bluff frequency makes them indifferent.” What does that mean mathematically, and why does it prevent exploitation?
- Why it matters: this introduces 13 Nash Equilibrium (GTO), 14 Indifference Conditions.

## Mathematical Framework and Poker Theory

### Roadmap

- Best responses in finite games
- Equilibrium definitions
- Indifference conditions in support
- Value/bluff balance intuition

### Definitions

**best response.** *[Definition.]*

**Nash equilibrium.** *[Definition.]*

**support of a mixed strategy.** *[Definition.]*

**indifference condition.** *[Definition.]*

### Core concepts

- mutual best responses
- stability
- equilibrium vs outcome

### Core results

**Nash equilibrium conditions (finite games).** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

**indifference principle for mixed strategies (support equations).** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

### Worked example ideas

- Derive bluff frequency that makes a defender indifferent in a toy model

### Computation notes

['Optional: verify with numerical best responses']

## Beyond Poker

These applications use the same core mathematical move: define a model, quantify uncertainty/value, and choose actions under constraints.

Possible directions:

- economics (market competition models)
- political science (strategic voting/campaigning)
- evolutionary biology (stable strategies)

## Liberal Arts Sidebar

**Stability vs Justice**

*Lens:* Political philosophy

*Theme:* Equilibria can be stable yet unfair; parallels with social/market equilibria that entrench inequality.

> Should stability be valued over fairness? Can an equilibrium be unjust?

## Homework Problems

Use these as problem prompts to develop a full set:

1. Compute with definitions and formulas
2. Explain a concept in words
3. Short proof or justification (when appropriate)

1. *[Problem to be written.]*

## Extension Activity

Extend the chapter’s main tool using a small simulation or a short written reflection connecting poker to another domain.
