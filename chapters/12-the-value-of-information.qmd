**Chapter at a glance**

- **Part:** Part IV: Optimization
- **Poker topics:** 18 Value of Information, 10 Information Asymmetry
- **Beyond poker:** market research (buying data), scientific experimentation (value of trials), intelligence/surveillance (cost–benefit)

:::

## Motivating Example

You can call to ‘see one more card’ but it costs money. Sometimes buying information is worth it; sometimes it’s not.

**Guiding question.** When is information worth paying for, and how much should we pay?

- Situation: You can call to ‘see one more card’ but it costs money. Sometimes buying information is worth it; sometimes it’s not.
- Why it matters: this introduces 18 Value of Information, 10 Information Asymmetry.

## Mathematical Framework and Poker Theory

### Roadmap

- Information sets and what a bet 'buys'
- EVPI/EVSI definitions
- When information has negative side-effects
- Poker examples: calling to realize/see

### Definitions

**information set.** *[Definition.]*

**value of information.** *[Definition.]*

**EVPI.** *[Definition.]*

**EVSI.** *[Definition.]*

### Core concepts

- opportunity cost
- information asymmetry
- decision improvement

### Core results

**non-negativity of information value (EVPI ≥ 0).** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

**information dominance (conceptual).** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

### Worked example ideas

- Compute EVPI in a toy draw decision with/without seeing the next card

### Computation notes

["Optional: simulate value of a 'free card' in a simplified model"]

## Beyond Poker

These applications use the same core mathematical move: define a model, quantify uncertainty/value, and choose actions under constraints.

Possible directions:

- market research (buying data)
- scientific experimentation (value of trials)
- intelligence/surveillance (cost–benefit)

## Liberal Arts Sidebar

**Surveillance, Privacy, and Power**

*Lens:* Ethics / political science

*Theme:* Information has value, but collecting it can violate consent or amplify power asymmetries.

> When is information gathering unethical, even if it increases expected value?

## Homework Problems

Use these as problem prompts to develop a full set:

1. Compute with definitions and formulas
2. Explain a concept in words
3. Short proof or justification (when appropriate)

1. *[Problem to be written.]*
2. *[Problem to be written.]*
3. *[Problem to be written.]*

## Extension Activity

Extend the chapter’s main tool using a small simulation or a short written reflection connecting poker to another domain.
