**Chapter at a glance**

- **Part:** Part II: Probability, Expectation, and Belief Updating
- **Poker topics:** 1 Expected Value (EV), 2 Variance and Volatility, 3 Risk vs Reward Tradeoffs
- **Beyond poker:** finance (returns and volatility), operations research (expected cost vs variability), psychology (behavioral variability)

## Motivating Example

Two lines have the same EV, but one is swingy and one is steady. Which is “better” and why do people disagree?

**Guiding question.** How do we measure not just average outcomes, but variability and risk?

- Situation: Two lines have the same EV, but one is swingy and one is steady. Which is “better” and why do people disagree?
- Why it matters: this introduces 1 Expected Value (EV), 2 Variance and Volatility.

## Mathematical Framework and Poker Theory

### Roadmap

- Random variables for outcomes (profit/loss)
- Expected value and interpretation
- Variance/standard deviation
- Comparing lines with equal EV

### Definitions

**random variable (discrete).** *[Definition.]*

**PMF.** *[Definition.]*

**expected value.** *[Definition.]*

**variance.** *[Definition.]*

**standard deviation.** *[Definition.]*

### Core concepts

- distribution vs outcome
- volatility and dispersion
- linearity of expectation

### Core results

**linearity of expectation.** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

**variance identities.** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

**variance of sums (independent case).** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

### Worked example ideas

- Two betting lines with equal EV but different variance; compute both

### Computation notes

['Simulate distributions of outcomes to visualize variance']

## Beyond Poker

These applications use the same core mathematical move: define a model, quantify uncertainty/value, and choose actions under constraints.

Possible directions:

- finance (returns and volatility)
- operations research (expected cost vs variability)
- psychology (behavioral variability)

## Liberal Arts Sidebar

**Why Humans Hate Variance**

*Lens:* Psychology

*Theme:* Why people prefer predictability—even at the cost of lower EV—and how that shapes real decision-making.

> Is avoiding variance rational, emotional, or both? When is it justified?

## Homework Problems

Use these as problem prompts to develop a full set:

1. Compute with definitions and formulas
2. Explain a concept in words
3. Short proof or justification (when appropriate)

## Extension Activity

Extend the chapter’s main tool using a small simulation or a short written reflection connecting poker to another domain.
