**Chapter at a glance**

- **Part:** Part II: Probability, Expectation, and Belief Updating
- **Poker topics:** 1 Expected Value (EV), 4 Equity and Realization, 5 Multi-Stage Decision Making, 17 Pot Odds and Threshold Decisions
- **Beyond poker:** business strategy (sequential investments), environmental policy (choices with future uncertainty), AI (planning under uncertainty)

## Motivating Example

A call looks unprofitable immediately, but it keeps open future betting opportunities that can make the overall line profitable.

**Guiding question.** How do we evaluate decisions whose consequences unfold over multiple stages?

- Situation: A call looks unprofitable immediately, but it keeps open future betting opportunities that can make the overall line profitable.
- Why it matters: this introduces 1 Expected Value (EV), 4 Equity and Realization.

## Mathematical Framework and Poker Theory

### Roadmap

- Decision trees for poker streets
- Conditional expectation along the tree
- Pot odds and break-even thresholds
- Equity realization across streets

### Definitions

**expected value of an action.** *[Definition.]*

**conditional expectation.** *[Definition.]*

**break-even probability.** *[Definition.]*

**equity.** *[Definition.]*

### Core concepts

- decision trees
- multi-stage uncertainty
- threshold decision rules
- equity realization

### Core results

**law of total expectation (total expectation).** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

**dominance principle (informal).** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

### Worked example ideas

- Turn decision with river consequences; compute EV by conditioning on river outcomes

### Computation notes

['Monte Carlo to estimate multi-street EV when the tree is large']

## Beyond Poker

These applications use the same core mathematical move: define a model, quantify uncertainty/value, and choose actions under constraints.

Possible directions:

- business strategy (sequential investments)
- environmental policy (choices with future uncertainty)
- AI (planning under uncertainty)

## Liberal Arts Sidebar

**Short-Term Pain, Long-Term Gain**

*Lens:* Moral philosophy

*Theme:* Ethical frameworks that emphasize long-run consequences—and when maximizing long-run value can conflict with other values.

> Is maximizing long-run value always ethically justified? What other values might matter?

## Homework Problems

Use these as problem prompts to develop a full set:

1. Compute with definitions and formulas
2. Explain a concept in words
3. Short proof or justification (when appropriate)

## Extension Activity

Extend the chapter’s main tool using a small simulation or a short written reflection connecting poker to another domain.
