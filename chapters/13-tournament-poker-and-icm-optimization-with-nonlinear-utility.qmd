**Chapter at a glance**

- **Beyond poker:** winner-take-all labor markets (careers, entertainment), public policy (threshold incentives), economics of inequality (nonlinear rewards)

## Motivating Example

Near the bubble, someone folds a strong hand—absurd in cash games. Why do incentives flip in tournaments?

**Guiding question.** Why does the same chip have different value in tournaments than in cash games?

- Situation: Near the bubble, someone folds a strong hand—absurd in cash games. Why do incentives flip in tournaments?
- Why it matters: this introduces 19 Tournament vs Cash Incentives, 20 ICM and Nonlinear Utility.

## Mathematical Framework and Poker Theory

### Roadmap

- Why chip EV differs from money EV
- Utility and payout ladders
- ICM mechanics (conceptual + calculations)
- Bubble/ladder implications for decisions

### Definitions

**utility function.** *[Definition.]*

**expected utility.** *[Definition.]*

**Independent Chip Model (ICM).** *[Definition.]*

**payoff structure (payout ladder).** *[Definition.]*

### Core concepts

- nonlinear payoffs
- marginal chip value
- risk sensitivity / bubble pressure
- chip EV vs $EV

### Core results

**expected utility maximization (decision criterion).** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

**chip EV ≠ dollar EV (formal statement under nonlinear utility).** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

### Worked example ideas

- Compute ICM equity in a small payout example and compare two shove/call lines

### Computation notes

['Optional: simulate finish orders to estimate ICM equity (simple)']

## Beyond Poker

These applications use the same core mathematical move: define a model, quantify uncertainty/value, and choose actions under constraints.

Possible directions:

- winner-take-all labor markets (careers, entertainment)
- public policy (threshold incentives)
- economics of inequality (nonlinear rewards)

## Liberal Arts Sidebar

**Winner-Take-All Systems**

*Lens:* Economics / social justice

*Theme:* How nonlinear reward structures change behavior and risk-taking; fairness and distributional consequences.

> Are winner-take-all systems fair? What incentives do they create?

## Homework Problems

Use these as problem prompts to develop a full set:

1. Compute with definitions and formulas
2. Explain a concept in words
3. Short proof or justification (when appropriate)
