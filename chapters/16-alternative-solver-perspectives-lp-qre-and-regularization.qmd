## Motivating Example

Different solver settings produce different strategies. Which is ‘right’? The answer depends on assumptions baked into the model.

**Guiding question.** How do modeling assumptions change the ‘optimal’ strategy a solver returns?

- Situation: Different solver settings produce different strategies. Which is ‘right’? The answer depends on assumptions baked into the model.
- Why it matters: this introduces 23 Approximate Equilibria.

## Mathematical Framework and Poker Theory

### Roadmap

- LP viewpoint on equilibrium (high level)
- Regularization as stability/behavior model
- QRE as bounded rationality
- Comparing outputs under assumptions

### Definitions

**linear program (LP).** *[Definition.]*

**feasible region.** *[Definition.]*

**regularization.** *[Definition.]*

**quantal response equilibrium (QRE).** *[Definition.]*

### Core concepts

- smooth vs sharp best responses
- stability vs optimality
- modeling assumptions

### Core results

**LP duality (conceptual statement).** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

**existence of QRE (stated).** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

### Worked example ideas

- Compare sharp best response vs smoothed (QRE) response in a toy 2x2

### Computation notes

['Optional: numerical solve of QRE in a 2x2 game']

## Beyond Poker

These applications use the same core mathematical move: define a model, quantify uncertainty/value, and choose actions under constraints.

Possible directions:

- econometrics (regularized estimation)
- behavioral economics (bounded rationality)
- optimization theory (convex relaxations)

## Liberal Arts Sidebar

**Models Shape Reality**

*Lens:* Philosophy of science

*Theme:* Do models merely describe behavior, or do they shape what we consider rational and true?

> Is there such a thing as a ‘true’ model, or only useful models for purposes?

## Homework Problems

Use these as problem prompts to develop a full set:

1. Compute with definitions and formulas
2. Explain a concept in words
3. Short proof or justification (when appropriate)

1. *[Problem to be written.]*
2. *[Problem to be written.]*
3. *[Problem to be written.]*

## Extension Activity

Extend the chapter’s main tool using a small simulation or a short written reflection connecting poker to another domain.
