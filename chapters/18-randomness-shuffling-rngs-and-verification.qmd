## Motivating Example

Players suspect an online site’s shuffling is biased; the site claims it’s fair. What would ‘evidence’ look like?

**Guiding question.** How can randomness be tested, trusted, or verified?

- Situation: Players suspect an online site’s shuffling is biased; the site claims it’s fair. What would ‘evidence’ look like?
- Why it matters: this introduces 24 Randomness and Fair Dealing.

## Mathematical Framework and Poker Theory

### Roadmap

- What it means to be 'random'
- PRNGs vs true randomness
- Testing randomness and limitations
- Audits and transparency

### Definitions

**random permutation.** *[Definition.]*

**pseudorandom number generator (PRNG).** *[Definition.]*

**test statistic.** *[Definition.]*

**audit.** *[Definition.]*

### Core concepts

- fairness
- independence
- limits of statistical testing

### Core results

**uniformity over permutations (conceptual).** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

**limits of hypothesis tests (interpretive).** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

### Worked example ideas

- Basic randomness diagnostic on a short sequence (conceptual)

### Computation notes

['Optional: generate PRNG samples and run simple diagnostics']

## Beyond Poker

These applications use the same core mathematical move: define a model, quantify uncertainty/value, and choose actions under constraints.

Possible directions:

- cryptography (secure randomness)
- elections (audits and fairness)
- scientific integrity (randomization)

## Liberal Arts Sidebar

**Trust in Institutions**

*Lens:* Political science

*Theme:* Societies rely on trusted randomness. When trust erodes, legitimacy collapses—how do institutions earn trust?

> How do institutions earn trust in randomness and fairness?

## Homework Problems

Use these as problem prompts to develop a full set:

1. Compute with definitions and formulas
2. Explain a concept in words
3. Short proof or justification (when appropriate)

1. *[Problem to be written.]*
2. *[Problem to be written.]*
3. *[Problem to be written.]*

## Extension Activity

Extend the chapter’s main tool using a small simulation or a short written reflection connecting poker to another domain.
