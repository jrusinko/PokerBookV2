## Motivating Example

After a sequence of actions, you try to infer what hands are still plausible. Good players do it intuitively—this chapter makes it explicit.

**Guiding question.** How do we represent and update uncertainty about hidden information?

- Situation: After a sequence of actions, you try to infer what hands are still plausible. Good players do it intuitively—this chapter makes it explicit.
- Why it matters: this introduces 6 Hand Ranges (Not Hands), 7 Range Construction and Narrowing.

## Mathematical Framework and Poker Theory

### Roadmap

- Representing ranges as distributions
- Action filters and likelihoods
- Blockers and combinatorial weighting
- Posterior ranges and strategy implications

### Definitions

**probability distribution on a finite set.** *[Definition.]*

**range (belief distribution).** *[Definition.]*

**likelihood.** *[Definition.]*

**posterior distribution.** *[Definition.]*

**blocker (card removal).** *[Definition.]*

### Core concepts

- belief modeling
- conditional distributions
- combinatorial weighting
- card removal effects

### Core results

**Bayes’ theorem (applied).** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

**normalization of distributions.** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

### Worked example ideas

- Start with a preflop range; update through flop/turn actions; compute posterior weights for a few hand classes

### Computation notes

['Optional: simple range-tracking spreadsheet or script']

## Beyond Poker

These applications use the same core mathematical move: define a model, quantify uncertainty/value, and choose actions under constraints.

Possible directions:

- forensics (constraint-based inference)
- ecology (presence/absence inference)
- intelligence analysis (hypothesis filtering)

## Liberal Arts Sidebar

**Profiling, Stereotypes, and Inference**

*Lens:* Sociology & ethics

*Theme:* When inference from limited evidence becomes unjustified assumption; parallels between hand ranges and social profiling.

> When does inference become unjustified assumption? How should we handle uncertainty ethically?

## Homework Problems

Use these as problem prompts to develop a full set:

1. Compute with definitions and formulas
2. Explain a concept in words
3. Short proof or justification (when appropriate)

## Extension Activity

Extend the chapter’s main tool using a small simulation or a short written reflection connecting poker to another domain.
