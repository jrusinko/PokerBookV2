**Chapter at a glance**

- **Part:** Part VI: Randomness, Variance, and Statistical Judgment
- **Poker topics:** 25 Statistical Inference from Results, 24 Randomness and Fair Dealing
- **Beyond poker:** fraud detection (finance/insurance), academic integrity (plagiarism/cheating detection), network analysis (collusion detection)

## Motivating Example

Two players rarely play big pots against each other. Is it coincidence, shared style, or collusion?

**Guiding question.** How strong must evidence be before we accuse wrongdoing, and how do we manage false positives?

- Situation: Two players rarely play big pots against each other. Is it coincidence, shared style, or collusion?
- Why it matters: this introduces 25 Statistical Inference from Results, 24 Randomness and Fair Dealing.

## Mathematical Framework and Poker Theory

### Roadmap

- Hypotheses and test statistics
- Multiple comparisons and false alarms
- Network patterns and collusion signals
- Due process and decision thresholds

### Definitions

**null hypothesis.** *[Definition.]*

**alternative hypothesis.** *[Definition.]*

**test statistic.** *[Definition.]*

**p-value.** *[Definition.]*

**false positive/false negative.** *[Definition.]*

### Core concepts

- statistical power (informal)
- multiple testing
- correlation vs causation
- evidence vs proof

### Core results

**hypothesis testing framework (conceptual).** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

### Worked example ideas

- Toy example: unusual pattern → p-value; discuss why that’s not proof

### Computation notes

['Optional: simulate null distributions for a test statistic']

## Beyond Poker

These applications use the same core mathematical move: define a model, quantify uncertainty/value, and choose actions under constraints.

Possible directions:

- fraud detection (finance/insurance)
- academic integrity (plagiarism/cheating detection)
- network analysis (collusion detection)

## Liberal Arts Sidebar

**Accusation and Due Process**

*Lens:* Law & ethics

*Theme:* Statistical suspicion is not proof. How much evidence is enough to accuse someone, and what safeguards prevent moral panics?

> How much evidence is enough to accuse someone? What safeguards prevent moral panics?

## Homework Problems

Use these as problem prompts to develop a full set:

1. Compute with definitions and formulas
2. Explain a concept in words
3. Short proof or justification (when appropriate)

1. *[Problem to be written.]*
2. *[Problem to be written.]*

## Extension Activity

Extend the chapter’s main tool using a small simulation or a short written reflection connecting poker to another domain.
