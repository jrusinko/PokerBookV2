**Chapter at a glance**

## Motivating Example

Opponent raises the river. Is that strong or weak? The same action means different things depending on what you believed before.

**Guiding question.** How should new information change what we believe?

- Situation: Opponent raises the river. Is that strong or weak? The same action means different things depending on what you believed before.
- Why it matters: this introduces 9 Bayesian Updating (Implicit), 10 Information Asymmetry.

## Mathematical Framework and Poker Theory

### Roadmap

- Conditional probability as updating
- Total probability and partitions
- Bayes’ rule
- Poker reading: actions as evidence

### Definitions

**conditional probability.** *[Definition.]*

**joint probability.** *[Definition.]*

**independence.** *[Definition.]*

**conditional independence (informal).** *[Definition.]*

### Core concepts

- belief updating
- information flow

### Core results

**product rule.** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

**law of total probability.** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

**Bayes’ theorem.** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

### Worked example ideas

- Update belief about a range after a bet sizing choice

### Computation notes

['Optional: compute posterior range weights in a small discrete example']

## Beyond Poker

These applications use the same core mathematical move: define a model, quantify uncertainty/value, and choose actions under constraints.

Possible directions:

- medical testing (base rates)
- legal reasoning (evidence evaluation)
- machine learning (classification/update)

## Liberal Arts Sidebar

**Evidence and Base-Rate Neglect**

*Lens:* Law & ethics

*Theme:* How misunderstandings of conditional probability have contributed to wrongful convictions and flawed reasoning about evidence.

> Should juries (and the public) be taught probability explicitly? Why or why not?

## Homework Problems

Use these as problem prompts to develop a full set:

1. Compute with definitions and formulas
2. Explain a concept in words
3. Short proof or justification (when appropriate)

## Extension Activity

Extend the chapter’s main tool using a small simulation or a short written reflection connecting poker to another domain.
