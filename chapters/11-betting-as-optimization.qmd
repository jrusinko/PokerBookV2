**Chapter at a glance**

## Motivating Example

You think you’re ahead. Do you bet small to get called, or large to deny equity? Bet sizing is an optimization problem.

**Guiding question.** How do we choose bet sizes that balance value, fold equity, and risk?

- Situation: You think you’re ahead. Do you bet small to get called, or large to deny equity? Bet sizing is an optimization problem.
- Why it matters: this introduces 16 Bet Sizing as Optimization, 3 Risk vs Reward Tradeoffs.

## Mathematical Framework and Poker Theory

### Roadmap

- Objective functions for bet sizing (EV/utility)
- Constraints (stack sizes, pot, ranges)
- Tradeoffs: fold equity vs value
- Sizing heuristics and check strategies

### Definitions

**objective function.** *[Definition.]*

**constraint.** *[Definition.]*

**feasible set.** *[Definition.]*

**optimal solution.** *[Definition.]*

**marginal value.** *[Definition.]*

### Core concepts

- tradeoffs
- risk vs reward as constraints/objectives
- sizing as maximizing expected value (or utility)

### Core results

**finite optimization principle (argmax).** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

**marginal analysis principle (informal).** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

### Worked example ideas

- Choose a bet size maximizing EV in a simplified model with fold/call/raise frequencies

### Computation notes

['Optional: plot EV vs bet size over a parameter grid']

## Beyond Poker

These applications use the same core mathematical move: define a model, quantify uncertainty/value, and choose actions under constraints.

Possible directions:

- engineering design (optimize under constraints)
- portfolio allocation (risk/return)
- resource allocation (budgets/scheduling)

## Liberal Arts Sidebar

**Optimization and the Good Life**

*Lens:* Philosophy

*Theme:* Critiques of reducing life to objective functions; what should not be optimized (or cannot be).

> What should not be optimized? Where does optimization break down as a worldview?

## Homework Problems

Use these as problem prompts to develop a full set:

1. Compute with definitions and formulas
2. Explain a concept in words
3. Short proof or justification (when appropriate)

## Extension Activity

Extend the chapter’s main tool using a small simulation or a short written reflection connecting poker to another domain.
