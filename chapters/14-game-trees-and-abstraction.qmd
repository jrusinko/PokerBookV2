- **Poker topics:** 21 Game Trees and Abstraction
- **Beyond poker:** AI search trees, cognitive science (bounded rationality), software engineering (state abstraction)

## Motivating Example

A single hand branches into thousands of possible futures. Exact solving is impossible—so we simplify. But simplification has costs.

**Guiding question.** How can we simplify complex decision problems without losing what matters?

- Situation: A single hand branches into thousands of possible futures. Exact solving is impossible—so we simplify. But simplification has costs.
- Why it matters: this introduces 21 Game Trees and Abstraction.

## Mathematical Framework and Poker Theory

### Roadmap

- Extensive-form games and information sets
- Building a poker game tree
- Why abstraction is necessary
- Evaluating abstraction error

### Definitions

**extensive-form game.** *[Definition.]*

**game tree.** *[Definition.]*

**information set.** *[Definition.]*

**perfect vs imperfect information.** *[Definition.]*

**abstraction.** *[Definition.]*

### Core concepts

- state-space explosion
- approximation error
- state reduction/aggregation

### Core results

**normal-form vs extensive-form relationship (stated).** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

### Worked example ideas

- Draw a tiny heads-up game tree for a single street and show where information sets merge

### Computation notes

['Optional: count nodes in a simplified tree to see explosion']

## Beyond Poker

These applications use the same core mathematical move: define a model, quantify uncertainty/value, and choose actions under constraints.

Possible directions:

- AI search trees
- cognitive science (bounded rationality)
- software engineering (state abstraction)

## Liberal Arts Sidebar

**Bounded Rationality**

*Lens:* Cognitive science

*Theme:* Humans and institutions must abstract. When is simplification a necessity, and when does it become distortion?

> How much simplification is too much? Who is harmed by abstraction error?

## Homework Problems

Use these as problem prompts to develop a full set:

1. Compute with definitions and formulas
2. Explain a concept in words
3. Short proof or justification (when appropriate)

1. *[Problem to be written.]*
2. *[Problem to be written.]*
3. *[Problem to be written.]*

## Extension Activity

Extend the chapter’s main tool using a small simulation or a short written reflection connecting poker to another domain.
