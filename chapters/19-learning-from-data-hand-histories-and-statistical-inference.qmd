## Motivating Example

A player reviews a losing session and concludes they’re playing badly—but the sample is tiny. What can the data really support?

**Guiding question.** What can data tell us—and what can it not—about skill and decision quality?

- Situation: A player reviews a losing session and concludes they’re playing badly—but the sample is tiny. What can the data really support?
- Why it matters: this introduces 25 Statistical Inference from Results.

## Mathematical Framework and Poker Theory

### Roadmap

- From hands to data
- Estimators and uncertainty
- Bias/selection effects in tracking
- Practical inference: what conclusions are justified

### Definitions

**sample.** *[Definition.]*

**estimator.** *[Definition.]*

**sampling distribution (informal).** *[Definition.]*

**bias (estimator).** *[Definition.]*

### Core concepts

- sampling variability
- selection bias
- overfitting
- interpretation of uncertainty

### Core results

**law of large numbers (applied).** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

**bias–variance tradeoff (conceptual).** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

### Worked example ideas

- Given a winrate estimate and sample size, discuss plausible uncertainty and misinterpretation

### Computation notes

['Optional: bootstrap a statistic from a toy dataset']

## Beyond Poker

These applications use the same core mathematical move: define a model, quantify uncertainty/value, and choose actions under constraints.

Possible directions:

- sports analytics (evaluating performance)
- social science (observational data)
- education research (assessment)

## Liberal Arts Sidebar

**Data Isn’t Neutral**

*Lens:* Critical data studies

*Theme:* What gets measured reflects values. How can ‘objective’ data still embed bias or omit context?

> Who decides what counts as evidence? What gets ignored when we focus on data?

## Homework Problems

Use these as problem prompts to develop a full set:

1. Compute with definitions and formulas
2. Explain a concept in words
3. Short proof or justification (when appropriate)

1. *[Problem to be written.]*

## Extension Activity

Extend the chapter’s main tool using a small simulation or a short written reflection connecting poker to another domain.
