## Motivating Example

### A Single Hand, Played Well—and Lost

The opening scene of [*Rounders*]{.underline} introduces poker not as spectacle, but as structure. In a smoky New York card room, a young law student named Mike McDermott (played by Matt Damon) sits across the table from Teddy KGB (played by John Malkovich), a feared and experienced underground poker boss. The game is Texas Hold’em.

As the hand unfolds, Mike narrates the basic mechanics of the game: each player receives two private cards; five community cards are revealed in stages; between these stages, players may bet, call, raise, or fold. The explanation is brief, accurate, and embedded directly in play. Viewers unfamiliar with poker are not asked to memorize rules—they are invited to watch a decision problem take shape.

After the first three community cards—the *flop*—are revealed, Mike holds the strongest possible hand given the information currently available. In poker terminology, he has *the nuts*. At this moment, no opponent can be ahead of him.

Mike now faces a strategic choice, but it is subtler than it first appears.

A small bet might invite calls from weaker hands. Yet against Teddy KGB, Mike knows that such a bet would not be interpreted innocently. A small wager, in this context, would signal a trap. Anticipating this, Teddy would likely respond cautiously, limiting the amount of money he commits to the pot.

Mike therefore does the opposite. He bets large on the flop—not to force Teddy out, but to disguise the true strength of his hand. The large bet is intended to look like overconfidence or a bluff, inducing Teddy to continue with hands that are currently inferior. The decision is not about the size of the bet alone; it is about how that bet will be interpreted by a sophisticated opponent.

The next community card—the *turn*—changes the situation. While Mike is still ahead, the range of hands that Teddy could plausibly hold has improved. Importantly, however, Mike’s earlier reasoning has not been invalidated. Given the information available at the time of the flop decision, betting large was still consistent with his objective: to extract value from worse hands while disguising his own.

On the final card—the *river*—the uncertainty resolves against Mike. Teddy completes a stronger hand. At this point, the remaining decision is no longer about inducing action, but about responding to a realized outcome. The final betting round ends with all the money in the pot. Mike loses the hand—and with it, his entire bankroll.

This loss is not the result of misunderstanding the rules. It is not the result of failing to anticipate his opponent’s reasoning. It is the result of randomness resolving unfavorably *after* a carefully chosen action in a strategic setting.

The full scene can be viewed here:\

This hand is not memorable because someone lost at poker. Loss is routine. It is memorable because the loss follows a decision that was informed, context-sensitive, and defensible. The outcome is disastrous; the reasoning is not.

The question raised by this first hand is not *Why did Mike lose?*\
It is:

**How should we judge decisions when losing is sometimes unavoidable?**

This tension—between decision quality and realized outcome—is the central mathematical problem of poker. It is also a central problem in many domains beyond cards: investing, medicine, public policy, and everyday planning. Poker provides a rare environment in which the rules are explicit, the uncertainty is visible, and the consequences of chance are immediate.

Throughout this book, we will return to situations like this one. We will develop mathematical tools for evaluating decisions when outcomes are uncertain, distinguishing expectation from variance and sound reasoning from hindsight. Poker will serve not as a guide to winning money, but as a laboratory for understanding how rational decisions behave in an unpredictable world.

## Mathematical Framework and Poker Theory

### Roadmap

Poker is not a single game. It is a family of closely related games that share common elements—cards, betting, hidden information—but differ in how information is revealed, how bets are structured, and how success is measured. Before introducing mathematical tools for analyzing decisions in poker, we must first describe the *structure* of the environment in which those decisions are made.

This chapter establishes a shared language for the book. We will describe:

-   the basic components common to most poker games

-   the structure of a standard deck of cards

-   how hands are formed and ranked

-   how betting and information unfold over time

-   how different poker formats define different notions of “winning”

The goal is not to teach poker strategy. Rather, it is to specify the **rules of the decision problem**. Later chapters will introduce probability, expectation, and optimization, but those ideas only make sense once the underlying game and its outcomes have been clearly defined.

### Core Concepts

#### Poker as a Structured Decision Environment

Poker is a game of **incomplete information**: at the moment a decision is made, relevant facts—most importantly, other players’ private cards—are unknown.

We begin by formalizing the basic components shared by all poker games.

**Definition (Player).**\
A *player* is an individual participant who makes decisions during the game.

**Definition (Private information).**\
*Private information* consists of facts known to one player but not to others, such as cards dealt face down.

**Definition (Public information).**\
*Public information* consists of facts observable by all players, such as shared cards, betting actions, and the size of the pot.

**Definition (Action).**\
An *action* is a permitted choice available to a player at a given moment, such as betting, calling, raising, or folding.

**Definition (Game structure).**\
The *structure* of a poker game consists of:

-   the rules for dealing cards

-   the sequence of betting rounds

-   the actions available to players

-   the method for determining outcomes and payoffs

From a mathematical perspective, poker is a sequential decision problem in which players choose actions under uncertainty while accounting for the behavior of others.

#### The Deck of Cards

All poker games considered in this book are played using a standard deck of playing cards.

**Definition (Deck of cards).**\
A *standard deck* consists of 52 distinct cards, formed by the combination of:

-   13 **ranks**: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2

-   4 **suits**: clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades

Each card is uniquely identified by its rank–suit pair.

The deck contains no jokers and no duplicate cards. Cards are dealt **without replacement**, so once a card is dealt, it cannot appear again within the same hand.

Mathematically, the deck provides a **finite universe of equally well-defined outcomes**, which allows us to model poker hands using combinatorics and probability.

*Figure placeholder:* Structure of a standard 52-card deck.

#### Hands and Sample Spaces

The central mathematical object in poker is the *hand*.

**Definition (Hand).**\
A *hand* is a specified collection of cards drawn from the deck according to the rules of the poker variant being played.

For example:

-   In Texas Hold’em, a player ultimately forms a five-card hand using private and community cards.

-   In Seven-Card Stud, a player is dealt seven cards and the strongest five-card subset determines hand strength.

-   In Omaha, a hand is formed using exactly two private cards and three community cards.

From a probabilistic viewpoint, each possible hand corresponds to a distinct **outcome** of a random experiment.

**Definition (Sample space).**\
The *sample space*, denoted by Ω\OmegaΩ, is the set of all possible hands that can occur under the rules of the game.

The precise meaning of Ω\OmegaΩ depends on context. It may represent:

-   all possible five-card poker hands

-   all possible combinations of unseen cards at a given stage of play

-   all hands consistent with the public information currently available

At the beginning of a hand, the sample space Ω\OmegaΩ is large, reflecting substantial uncertainty. As cards are revealed, Ω\OmegaΩ is reduced: some outcomes become impossible, while others become certain.

This evolving sample space is one of poker’s defining features. Decisions are made **before** the final outcome is known, based on partial information about which elements of Ω\OmegaΩ remain plausible.

Later chapters will assign probabilities to subsets of Ω\OmegaΩ and use those probabilities to evaluate decisions mathematically.

#### Cards and Hand Rankings

Once a hand is complete, outcomes are compared using a fixed ranking system.

**Definition (Hand ranking).**\
A *hand ranking* is an ordering of hands from strongest to weakest used to determine the winner at the end of play.

From strongest to weakest, the standard poker hand rankings are:

-   Straight Flush (five cards of the same suit and in sequence)
-   Four of a Kind
-   Full House (three of a kind, and a pair)
-   Flush (five cards of the same suit)
-   Straight (five cards in rank sequence)
-   Three of a Kind
-   Two Pair
-   One Pair
-   High Card

These rankings define how realized outcomes are compared. They do **not** determine how decisions should be made during play, since decisions occur when only part of the sample space Ω\OmegaΩ is known.

![](images/clipboard-46565733.png)

#### Betting and the Flow of a Hand

Poker hands unfold through a sequence of betting rounds.

**Definition (Betting round).**\
A *betting round* is a stage of the hand during which players act in turn until all remaining players have either matched the current bet or folded.

During a betting round, players may take one of the following actions:

-   **bet**: place chips into the pot

-   **call**: match an existing bet

-   **raise**: increase the size of the current bet

-   **fold**: withdraw from the hand, forfeiting any chips already committed

Bets simultaneously affect the size of the pot and the information available to other players.

Most poker games include forced bets at the start of each hand.

**Definition (Blind).**\
A *blind* is a mandatory bet posted by designated players before cards are dealt.

**Definition (Ante).**\
An *ante* is a small mandatory bet contributed by all players before the hand begins.

Forced bets ensure that every hand has value, preventing indefinite waiting.

#### Community Cards and Information Revelation

Many poker variants reveal information gradually through shared cards.

In **Texas Hold’em**, five community cards are revealed in stages:

-   **Flop**: the first three community cards

-   **Turn**: the fourth community card

-   **River**: the fifth and final community card

A betting round occurs between each stage.

![](images/clipboard-3311611704.png){width="577"}

**Definition (Community card).**\
A *community card* is a card shared by all players and used by each to form a hand.

At any point in the hand, a player’s decision depends on:

-   private cards

-   visible community cards

-   observed betting behavior

#### Common Poker Variants

Different poker variants emphasize different structural features.

**Texas Hold’em**

-   Two private cards per player

-   Five community cards

-   Best five-card hand formed from any combination

**Seven-Card Stud**

-   Seven cards dealt per player

-   First two cards face down, third through 6th face up, seventh card face down.

-   No community cards

**Omaha**

-   Four private cards per player

-   Five community cards

-   Exactly two private cards and three community cards must be used

#### Cash Games and Tournament Poker

Poker is commonly played in two formats.

In **cash games**, chips correspond directly to money, and decisions are typically evaluated by long-run average gain or loss.

In **tournament poker**, chips determine survival and relative position, and losing all chips results in elimination. Chips do not have a fixed cash value.

Because the objectives differ, the same action may be reasonable in one format and inappropriate in the other.

#### Why Structure Comes First

Before we can count outcomes, compute probabilities, or evaluate expectations, we must first specify **the sample space** Ω\OmegaΩ and the rules that govern it.

Poker’s value as a mathematical laboratory lies in the clarity of its structure. Once the structure is fixed, mathematics can be applied. Without it, evaluation is meaningless.

> A decision cannot be judged independently of the structure in which it is made.

### Worked Examples: Hands as Evolving States

We now examine three worked examples—one each from Texas Hold’em, Omaha, and Seven-Card Stud. These examples are designed to illustrate **how poker hands unfold structurally**: how forced bets create an initial state, how action proceeds in order, how betting rounds end, and how information is revealed over time.

Throughout, we follow the perspective of **Hero**, while other players who continue in the hand are referred to as **Villains**.

#### Position Notation and Order of Action (8-Handed Tables)

Unless otherwise stated, we assume an **9-handed table**. Positions are named relative to the dealer button (BTN), which determines the order of betting.

Before any cards are dealt, the **button** marks the nominal dealer position. The **small blind (SB)** sits immediately to the left of the button, and the **big blind (BB)** sits to the left of the small blind. In games with a big blind ante, the BB also posts the ante for the table.

Preflop betting begins with the player **under the gun (UTG)**, the first seat to the left of the big blind, and proceeds clockwise around the table. After the flop, turn, and river, betting begins instead with the **first remaining player to the left of the button**, typically the small blind if still in the hand.

Acting later in a betting round means acting with more information about other players’ choices, which is why position plays such a central role in poker.

![](images/clipboard-1612495398.png){width="716"}

### Worked Example 1: Texas Hold’em

*Blinds, Big Blind Ante, and Betting Order*

This example illustrates blinds, the big blind ante, and how betting order changes after the flop.

The game is no-limit Texas Hold’em. Stakes are \$1 / \$2 with a \$2 big blind ante. Hero is seated in the cutoff (CO). The Villains who continue in the hand are on the button (BTN) and in the big blind (BB).

Before any cards are dealt, the small blind posts \$1, the big blind posts \$2, and the big blind also posts the \$2 ante on behalf of the table. These forced bets create an initial pot before any voluntary action occurs.

Hero is dealt **A♠ K♠**.

**Preflop.**\
Because preflop action begins to the left of the big blind, UTG acts first. Action proceeds clockwise. Players from UTG through HJ fold. When the action reaches Hero in the cutoff, Hero raises to \$6. The button, acting next, calls. The small blind folds. The big blind, having already posted \$2, calls the remaining \$4. Preflop betting ends because all remaining players have matched the highest bet.

**Flop.**\
The flop is dealt: **K♦ 7♠ 3♣**. From this point forward, betting begins with the first active player to the left of the button. The small blind has folded, so the big blind acts first. The big blind checks. Hero now acts and bets \$8. The button calls. The big blind folds. The betting round ends once the remaining players have matched the bet.

**Turn.**\
The turn card is revealed: **2♥**. With only Hero and the button remaining, Hero acts first because Hero is out of position relative to the button. Hero bets \$18. The button calls. Betting ends for the turn.

**River.**\
The final card is revealed: **9♣**. Hero again acts first and bets \$35. The button folds. Because no call is made, the hand ends immediately without a showdown.

At each stage, the betting order is fixed by position, and the betting round ends when no further raises occur.

**Poker shorthand.**\
`$1/$2 NLH BBA | Hero CO A♠K♠ | Pre: folds, RFI, BTN/BB call | Flop K73r: BB x, Hero b, BTN c | Turn 2: Hero b, BTN c | River 9: Hero b, BTN f`

### Worked Example 2: Omaha

*Betting Order with Multiple Players*

This example emphasizes how betting order operates when several players remain in the hand.

The game is pot-limit Omaha with \$1 / \$2 blinds and a big blind ante. Hero is on the button. Villains who continue are in the hijack (HJ) and the big blind (BB). Hero is dealt **A♣ K♣ Q♦ J♦**.

**Preflop.**\
Action begins UTG and proceeds clockwise. All players fold until the hijack, who calls \$2. Hero calls on the button. The small blind folds. The big blind checks. Because all remaining players have matched the big blind, preflop betting ends.

**Flop.**\
The flop is **T♣ 9♠ 3♦**. Postflop betting begins with the first active player to the left of the button, which is the big blind. The big blind checks. The hijack bets \$6. Hero, acting last, calls. The big blind folds. The betting round ends.

**Turn.**\
The turn card is **2♣**. With two players remaining, the hijack acts first and bets \$18. Hero calls. Betting ends for the turn.

**River.**\
The river card is **8♥**. The hijack again acts first and bets \$30. Hero calls. Because the bet is called, the hand proceeds to showdown.

Hero forms a straight using **Q♦ J♦** from hand together with **T♣ 9♠ 8♥** from the board, as required by Omaha rules. The Villain shows two pair. Hero wins.

**Poker shorthand.**\
`$1/$2 PLO BBA | Hero BTN AKQJds | Pre: HJ limp, Hero call, BB check | Flop T93: BB x, HJ b, Hero c | Turn 2: HJ b, Hero c | River 8: HJ b, Hero c | Hero wins`

### Worked Example 3: Seven-Card Stud

*Antes, Bring-In, and Dynamic Order*

This example illustrates how betting order in Seven-Card Stud depends on visible cards rather than fixed positions.

The game is seven-card stud with a \$1 ante and \$2 / \$4 betting limits. All players post the ante before cards are dealt. Each player receives two face-down cards and one face-up card.

Hero’s cards are **(A♠ A♦) K♣**, with the king face up. One Villain remains through the hand. The Villain’s upcard is **4♥**, the lowest visible card, so the Villain is required to post the bring-in.

**Third Street.**\
The Villain posts the \$1 bring-in. Action proceeds clockwise from the bring-in. Hero completes to \$2. All other players fold. The Villain calls. Betting ends.

**Fourth Street.**\
Each remaining player receives one face-up card. Hero receives **Q♠**. The Villain receives **9♦**. On this street and all subsequent streets, the player showing the highest hand acts first. Hero now shows the strongest visible hand and bets \$2. The Villain calls.

**Fifth Street.**\
Each player receives another face-up card. Hero receives **2♣**. The Villain receives **J♠**. Betting limits increase on this street. Hero still shows the strongest hand and bets \$4. The Villain calls.

**Sixth Street.**\
Each player receives a final face-up card. Hero receives **7♥**. The Villain receives **T♣**. Hero again acts first and bets \$4. The Villain folds, ending the hand.

In stud, betting order is recalculated on each street based on visible cards, and information is revealed asymmetrically rather than through shared cards.

**Poker shorthand.**\
`$1 ante Stud | Hero (A♠A♦)K♣ | 3rd: Villain brings, Hero completes | 4th: Hero b, Villain c | 5th: Hero b, Villain c | 6th: Hero b, Villain f`

## Beyond Poker

The structural features introduced in this chapter—partial information, sequential decisions, and the distinction between decision quality and realized outcomes—are not unique to poker. Poker is valuable as a mathematical laboratory precisely because these features are explicit and visible. Outside of poker, the same structures appear, but often without clear boundaries or agreed-upon rules.

Two such settings are especially instructive: decision-making under partial information, and the evaluation of decisions when outcomes are noisy.

### Sequential Decisions Under Partial Information

In poker, players act before all cards are revealed. At the moment a bet is made on the flop, the turn and river are unknown. The decision is therefore based not on a single outcome, but on a *set of possible futures*. As community cards are revealed, that set shrinks, but it never disappears until the hand ends.

This structure appears in many real-world decision environments.

Consider medical diagnosis. A physician does not begin with a complete picture of a patient’s condition. Initial symptoms constrain the set of plausible diagnoses, but rarely identify a single cause. Each test result—blood work, imaging, or response to treatment—functions like a revealed card in poker. Some possibilities are eliminated; others remain viable. Crucially, decisions must be made *before* all tests are complete: whether to begin treatment, order further testing, or wait. Acting too early carries risk; acting too late may also be harmful.

From a mathematical perspective, the physician is operating within a sample space of possible conditions and updating that space as information arrives. The structure of the problem—not the specific medical details—determines what constitutes a reasonable decision at each stage.

A similar structure governs many legal and political decision processes, particularly those shaped by procedural order.

In legislative bodies and courts, decisions are rarely made with full information. New evidence emerges, testimony unfolds, amendments are proposed, and political constraints shift over time. Yet procedural rules determine *when* actors must commit to positions. Agenda-setting rules decide which proposals are considered first, which may be amended, and which may never reach a vote at all.

These rules function like position and betting order in poker. Early movers commit with limited information but shape the path of subsequent decisions. Later actors benefit from observing earlier actions but are constrained by what has already been placed on the table. The outcome of a vote or ruling may hinge less on preferences than on the order in which options are considered.

Here again, the mathematics lies in the structure: sequential decisions under partial information, shaped by rules that fix who acts when and with what knowledge.

### Decision Quality Versus Outcome

One of the most persistent errors in reasoning about uncertainty is judging decisions solely by their outcomes. Poker makes this error visible. A player may make a mathematically sound decision—one that is favorable given the available information—and still lose the hand. Conversely, a poor decision may occasionally succeed.

This distinction between decision quality and outcome quality extends far beyond poker.

In finance, an investor may construct a diversified portfolio based on sound reasoning and still experience losses during a market downturn. Another investor may concentrate wealth in a single asset and enjoy a short-term gain. Evaluating these decisions based only on realized returns confuses luck with judgment. Over short horizons, outcomes are dominated by randomness; over longer horizons, the quality of the underlying decision process becomes visible.

Sports analytics offers a parallel example. In American football, fourth-down decisions are increasingly evaluated using probabilistic models. These models often recommend aggressive choices—going for a conversion rather than punting—that increase the probability of winning on average. Any single attempt, however, may fail. When it does, the decision is often criticized, even if the same choice would have been praised had it succeeded. The evaluation shifts with the outcome, not with the reasoning.

Poker trains the opposite habit. Because losses are frequent and unavoidable, players who persist must learn to separate reasoning from results. This separation is not psychological resilience; it is mathematical necessity. Without it, learning collapses. A player who revises strategy every time a good decision loses will never converge toward sound play.

The same principle applies in medicine, law, public policy, and everyday planning. Policies judged by immediate effects invite overreaction. Legal strategies evaluated by single verdicts obscure systemic reasoning. Plans abandoned after a single failure reflect confusion between noise and signal.

Poker does not eliminate uncertainty. What it offers instead is clarity. The rules are fixed, the information structure is explicit, and the role of chance is visible. This clarity allows us to study, in its simplest form, a central mathematical problem:

How should decisions be evaluated when outcomes are uncertain, irreversible, and only partially informative?

That question, not the cards themselves, is what connects poker to the wider world.

## Liberal Arts Sidebar

### Games, Rules, and Social Meaning

*Lens: Cultural Anthropology*

To call something a *game* is already to make a cultural claim.

Across cultures, games do not merely entertain. They teach, rehearse, and reinforce ideas about what matters—competition or cooperation, endurance or ingenuity, individual success or collective continuity. As a result, the same formal structure can support very different interpretations of what a “good move” even is.

Consider **mancala-style games**, played across Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia for centuries. These games emphasize redistribution rather than elimination. Stones circulate through the board, and success often depends on anticipating long-term flows rather than delivering decisive blows. Winning is typically quiet, incremental, and cumulative. A single dramatic move rarely determines the outcome. Evaluating decisions in such games by short-term gain would miss their central logic.

Contrast this with **chess**, which emerged from courtly and military traditions. Chess is a game of total information and total commitment. Pieces are eliminated permanently. Sacrifice is valorized. Victory often hinges on a small number of irreversible decisions. In this setting, aggression and foresight are culturally meaningful virtues. Analysis naturally centers on decisive lines and forced sequences.

Or consider **lacrosse**, which has Indigenous origins in North America and was historically played as a ritual, diplomatic, and spiritual practice. Games could involve hundreds of players and last for days. The purpose was not simply to determine a winner, but to resolve conflict, honor the dead, or strengthen communal ties. To analyze such a game purely in terms of efficiency or outcome would be to misunderstand its role entirely.

Poker occupies an unusual position among games because it can be framed in all of these ways—and often is.

In a professional cash game, poker is treated as an economic system. Chips represent money, and decisions are judged by long-run profit. In tournament poker, survival and relative position dominate; preserving chips may be more important than accumulating them. In a casual home game, poker may function primarily as a social ritual, where conversation, humor, and shared experience matter more than who wins the pot.

The cards do not change. The rules do not change. What changes is the *meaning of success*.

This matters because mathematical analysis is never frame-free. When we model poker decisions, we implicitly decide what counts as a payoff, which risks are relevant, and which outcomes deserve attention. A model that evaluates decisions by expected monetary value assumes that accumulation is the primary goal. A model that prioritizes survival assumes scarcity and competition. A model that focuses on decision quality rather than outcome assumes that learning and reasoning are the values at stake.

Cultural anthropology reminds us that none of these assumptions is universal. They are choices—shaped by context, tradition, and purpose.

Poker is especially useful for studying this idea because it makes framing visible. Players routinely argue not about probabilities, but about *what the game is*. Are we here to make money, to outlast opponents, or simply to play well? Each answer leads to a different mathematical lens.

Seen this way, poker is not just a game to be analyzed. It is a case study in how humans impose meaning on formal systems—and how those meanings guide what we consider rational.

The deeper question, then, is not only how to analyze a game mathematically, but how our choice of analysis reflects what we believe the game is for.

Keeping that question in view will sharpen—not soften—the mathematics that follows.

## Extension Activity

### One Hand, Many Games

Throughout this chapter, we have emphasized that poker decisions cannot be evaluated without first specifying what a player is trying to optimize. Different players may approach the same hand with different goals, values, and interpretations of what the game is for. As a result, rational players can behave very differently—even when they face the same cards and the same rules.

In this activity, you will construct and analyze a single Texas Hold’em hand in which players bring **distinct perspectives** to the table.

### Part I: Constructing the Hand

Create a complete Texas Hold’em hand played at an eight-handed table. Clearly identify all player positions from UTG through the button, including the small blind and big blind. Specify the blind structure, and indicate whether the game includes a big blind ante.

Assign hole cards to **Hero** and to at least two **Villains**. Then describe the hand as it unfolds, street by street, including preflop, flop, turn, and river. On each street, describe the betting actions taken by the players who remain in the hand. Your hand should end either with a fold before showdown or with a showdown in which a winner is clearly determined.

The hand does not need to reflect optimal poker strategy, but it must be internally consistent with the rules of Texas Hold’em.

### Part II: Assigning Perspectives

Assign each active player in your hand a distinct perspective on what matters in the game. These perspectives should shape how players interpret risk, information, and success.

For example, one player might be focused primarily on long-run profit, evaluating decisions by average gain rather than short-term results. Another might prioritize survival, treating chips as a scarce resource and avoiding actions that risk elimination. A third player might be concerned with reputation or signaling, choosing actions partly to influence how others perceive them. Other players might treat the game as a social or communal activity, value boldness or resolve as a matter of honor, focus on gathering information rather than winning the pot, or strongly minimize risk in favor of predictability. Some players may judge decisions almost entirely by outcomes, treating wins as validation and losses as failure.

You may invent alternative perspectives, including ones grounded in cultural, institutional, or personal values, as long as each perspective is clearly stated and applied consistently throughout the hand.

### Part III: Explaining the Actions

Recount the hand from start to finish, explaining each player’s actions from that player’s own perspective. At each major decision point, describe what information the player had at the time, what constraints they faced—such as position, prior bets, or stack size—and how their perspective shaped the action they chose.

Different players may interpret the same bet or card very differently. Make these differences explicit in your explanation, and be clear about how a player’s reasoning follows from their stated viewpoint.

### Part IV: Interpreting the Outcome

After the hand concludes, step outside the action and reflect on how the players might view one another.

Discuss how each player might evaluate their own decisions regardless of the outcome. Consider how players might interpret their opponents’ actions or intentions, and identify disagreements that arise not from different facts, but from different views of what the game is. You do not need to decide who played “correctly.” Instead, focus on how different framings lead to different judgments about the same sequence of events.

### Submission Guidelines

Your submission should be approximately two to three pages and written in clear, well-organized prose. You may use diagrams or poker shorthand if helpful, but clarity of explanation is more important than technical detail.

This activity is not about finding the best play. It is about understanding how rules, information, and values interact to shape decisions—and how mathematical analysis depends on making those elements explicit.
