**Chapter at a glance**

- **Part:** Part III: Game Theory (Intro / Toy Models)
- **Poker topics:** 11 Zero-Sum Interaction, 12 Mixed Strategies
- **Beyond poker:** sports strategy (penalty kicks/play calling), cybersecurity (attack–defense), military strategy (adversarial planning)

## Motivating Example

If you always bluff, you get snapped; if you never bluff, you get overfolded against. Randomizing feels irrational—but can be optimal.

**Guiding question.** Why would a rational strategy ever involve deliberate randomness?

- Situation: If you always bluff, you get snapped; if you never bluff, you get overfolded against. Randomizing feels irrational—but can be optimal.
- Why it matters: this introduces 11 Zero-Sum Interaction, 12 Mixed Strategies.

## Mathematical Framework and Poker Theory

### Roadmap

- From poker situations to payoff matrices
- Mixed strategies and expected payoffs
- Why randomization prevents exploitation
- Toy poker-inspired games

### Definitions

**player.** *[Definition.]*

**strategy.** *[Definition.]*

**pure strategy.** *[Definition.]*

**mixed strategy.** *[Definition.]*

**payoff matrix.** *[Definition.]*

**zero-sum game.** *[Definition.]*

### Core concepts

- strategic interaction
- expected payoff under mixing
- randomization as strategy

### Core results

**expected payoff formula for mixed strategies.** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

**minimax principle (informal statement).** *[Statement / proof placeholder.]*

### Worked example ideas

- Solve a 2x2 bluff/call toy game; find optimal mixing

### Computation notes

['Optional: simulate exploitability when deviating from mix']

## Beyond Poker

These applications use the same core mathematical move: define a model, quantify uncertainty/value, and choose actions under constraints.

Possible directions:

- sports strategy (penalty kicks/play calling)
- cybersecurity (attack–defense)
- military strategy (adversarial planning)

## Liberal Arts Sidebar

**War, Games, and Human Cost**

*Lens:* History / ethics

*Theme:* Game theory’s military origins and critiques of zero-sum framing that can dehumanize opponents or obscure moral stakes.

> When is it dangerous to view the world as zero-sum? What gets lost in that framing?

## Homework Problems
